## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow




### What I learned

This is my second time building this project. My emphasis again was on getting some practice with images. This time I chose to insert the image with an img tag. I had to use the object-fit property in order to get the image to present properly.
